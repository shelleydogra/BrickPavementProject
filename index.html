			            <br>This projects goal was to use BARR antique brick to lay a pathway next to the drive way.
		                Also to direct the water away from the house.  Lay down the electrical line for a lamp
		                post and then install the lamp post itself. <br>
		                <br> The project took about a month to complete with 2-3 hours of labor, on average, a week. <br>
		                <br> I did the project with my neighbor on his property in the summer of 2013.  It was a hard project, very intensive hard labor, but we saved a lot of money.  The most important thing was that I made a bunch of cold hard CASH! <br />
